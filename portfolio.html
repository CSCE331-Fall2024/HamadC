    <h2>Personal Calendar App</h2>
    <h3>Technologies used: Kotlin, XML, SQLite, Android Studio</h3>
    <p>The Personal Calendar App was my introduction to app development as well as the Kotlin language. 
      I learned key programming concepts such as MVC (Model, View, Controller), the Waterfall method, and the importance of user feedback.
      <br>
      The purpose of the calendar app is to keep users organized with features such as event creation, delition and modification, scheduling, and sharing events with others. 
      My future plans with this project is to create "Groups" where users can come together to create and share events. This feature is aimed towards families, friend groups, and small business teams who
      have a lot of evengs going on in their lives. What will make this feature stand out is that you can choose which members of your group get invited to the event to keep things simple. I also have plans
      to integrate with other popular calendar apps such as Google Calendar and the Apple Calendar.

    <h2>Classic Tetris</h2>
    <h3>Technologies Used: Ruby</h3>
    <p>Classic Tetris, everyone's favorite! I built a fully functional Tetris game in Ruby, following the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) design process. The project emphasized creating a solid foundation before 
      iterating with enhancements, such as custom tetromino pieces. These modifications were implemented through class inheritance, allowing for extensible and maintainable code. This experience reinforced 
      my skills in game development, object-oriented programming, and design patterns.</p>

    <h2>16-bit CPU</h2>
    <h3>Technologies Used: HDL, Computer Architecture, Assembly</h3>
    <p>This project was made for my class in Computer Organization where I learned how to design a 16-bit CPU from scratch. We started off learning logic gate desgin, then moved up to Adders and ALU, RAM Registers
      and finally the CPU. It was able to control memory registers (both reading and writing to memory) as well as draw images on a simulated screen. This project taught me a lot about the inner workings of Computer Systems
      and is what encouraged me to pursue the field of low-level programming.

    <h2>Texas Instruments (TI) Microcontrollers</h2>
    <h3>Technologies Used: C/C++, Code Composer Studio, BLE Stack</h3>
    <p>
      I worked on several projects using TI microcontrollers and Arduino. I focused on low-level programming to control hardware components and write custom firmware. These projects helped me get a solid grasp of embedded programming,
      real-time systems, and the ins and outs of hardware-software integration, which are crucial for working in resource-constrained environments.
