    <h2>Sea Aggie Coding Club - Event Coordinator</h2>
    <p>
      As the Events Coordinator, I play a key role in shaping the experiences our members gain throughout the year. 
      By preparing, planning, and executing a variety of events, I aim to create opportunities that not only foster learning 
      but also inspire a deeper passion for Computer Science. We've hosted events introducing members to programming languages
      like Python, which give them hands-on coding experience, as well as inviting Guest Lecturers from across campus who bring
      unique perspectives on topics ranging from data science to cybersecurity. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Additionally, I have organized Hackathons, which provide a collaborative and competitive environment for students to solve 
      real-world problems and push the boundaries of their skills. My ultimate goal with this organization is to empower members 
      to build strong portfolios that showcase their capabilities while also broadening their understanding of just how varied and 
      impactful Computer Science applications can be. From software development and artificial intelligence to embedded systems and 
      web technologies, I aim to provide a well-rounded experience that prepares our members for their future careers.

    <h2>Galveston Engineering Student Organization</h2>
    <p>
      I helped establish the Galveston Engineering Student Organization (GESO) after noticing the limited opportunities available
      for freshman engineers on the Galveston campus. GESO was created with the goal of providing freshman students with more 
      exposure to the diverse fields within engineering, helping them make more informed decisions about their future academic paths. 
      <br>
      <br>

      Through GESO, we organized events that explored various engineering disciplinesâ€”ranging from mechanical and civil engineering 
      to electrical and aerospace. These events not only introduced students to different career possibilities but also offered practical 
      insights and advice for navigating the ETAM (Entry to a Major) process. By giving students a clearer understanding of the engineering 
      landscape early on, we aimed to guide them in choosing the major that aligns best with their interests and career goals.

    <h2>Houston Food Bank</h2>
    <p>
      As a volunteer, I helped the Houston Food Bank's mission to alleviate hunger and provide nourishment to those in need within the community.

      Many of my tasks included: sorting and packaging food items, assisting with distribution efforts, and helping to organize donation drives. 
      I worked alongside other dedicated volunteers and staff, and gained a firsthand understanding of the challenges faced by those experiencing 
      food insecurity and gained an appreciation for what I have been blessed with.

    <h2>TAMU Big Event</h2>
    <p>
      Participating in The Big Event has been an incredible experience for me. As the largest one-day, student-run service project in the nation, 
      it brings together tens of thousands of Texas A&M students each spring to give back to the residents of Bryan and College Station. For over 42 years, 
      Aggie students have taken part in this tradition, completing service projects like yard work, window washing, and painting for local residents.

      I felt truly honored to be a part of this event, giving back to the university and community that have given me so much. It was a meaningful way 
      to express my gratitude and contribute to the community that supports us all.
