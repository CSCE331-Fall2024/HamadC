  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <div id = "my-info">
    <p>I am originally from Connecticut, but I grew up in the United Arab Emirates. I have two younger sisters, both of whom are in high school.
      In my free time I like to play video games like Minecraft and Street Fighter, build Legos, or go to the gym. I also enjoy reading and playing
      games of Warhammer 40k, which is my newest obsession. I've (unsuccessfully) been learning how to cook and I know my way around the kitchen. 
    </p>

    <h1>Why Computer Science?</h1>
    <p>My first introduction to computers came from my dad, who loved taking apart and building computers from scratch. 
      Every time he would get to work, I would be next to him, asking questions and handing him the wrong tools even if he
      never asked for one. When I was 11, my dad introduced me to Scratch, a simple drag-and-drop style method of "coding" created 
      by MIT and aimed at curious kids like me. I made my first game in Scratch, a simple platformer, and from then on it was off to the
      races. I learned Python in High School, and make more games and apps along the way. I used those programming skills in my school's Robotics Team
      to program the movement of my team's robot so that it could be remote controlled. 
      <br>
      <br>
      I study Computer Science because I have been surrounded by technology all my life. From watching my dad build computers to building my own robot
      for a competition, I saw just how varied and amazing the world of programming can be. And that is why I love to code - everyday is a new challenge 
      for me to broaden my horizons and for me to learn something new.
