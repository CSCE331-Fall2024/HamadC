# Project 1 Description
You will create a website that projects the professional image you would like recruiters and organizations to see when you introduce yourself.
You will develop the website on your local machine and host it on people.tamu.edu.
Your website will showcase the ability to toggle between multiple styles through CSS and JavaScript to completely change the look, feel, and layout of your website.
See CSS Zen Garden (http://csszengarden.com/Links to an external site.) for an example of the impact of different CSS files on HTML.
This will create a tool for you to share your professional portfolio and information about yourself even outside and beyond this course.
